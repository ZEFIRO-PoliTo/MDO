# **Task 3 – Volume Constraints and Optimization**

## **Description**

This task extends the fuselage internal-volume placement system developed in **Task 2** by introducing the framework for **constraint-based placement** and **optimization**.

---

## **Inputs**

### 1. **CSV File: Fuselage Batch Log**

Path:

```
../fuselage_iterator/fuselage_batch_log.csv
```

#### Format:

| filename        | length | width | height |
| --------------- | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| fuselage_1.vsp3 | 3.2    | 0.9   | 1.1    |
| fuselage_2.vsp3 | 4.0    | 1.0   | 1.2    |

* The first line is a header and is ignored.
* Each fuselage listed is processed individually from:

  ```
  ../fuselage_iterator/<filename>
  ```

### 2. **Fuselage Geometry**

* Each `.vsp3` file must contain a geometry with `"fuse"` in its name.
* Bounding box data (min/max extents) is extracted from OpenVSP.

---

## **Outputs**

### 1. **Console Feedback**

For each fuselage:

```
[INFO] Processing fuselage_X.vsp3...
[INFO] Collision detected = False
[SUCCESS] Saved modified fuselage: fuselage_X_with_volumes.vsp3
```

### 2. **Modified OpenVSP Models**

* Files saved in the same directory as the input:

  ```
  fuselage_X_with_volumes.vsp3
  ```
* Each includes the fuselage and a number of internal **ellipsoids** representing the box volumes placed within.

---

## **Algorithm / Procedure**

### **1. Fuselage Loading**

* The script clears the VSP model and loads each `.vsp3` file.
* It searches for a geometry name containing “fuse”.
* Bounding dimensions are computed through the `analyze_fuselage_geometry()` function.

### **2. Volume Placement**

* Volumes are represented by **`Box`** objects.
* A fixed number of volumes (currently 5 per fuselage) are created.
* Positions are generated randomly inside the fuselage bounding box.

### **3. Collision Checking**

* Implemented through `check_collision(volumes)` from `collision.py`.
* Detects overlaps using AABB/OBB geometric tests.

### **4. Visualization**

* Each box is visualized in OpenVSP as an **ELLIPSOID** to ensure API compatibility.
* Scaling and translation are handled through OpenVSP parameters:

  * `X_Scale`, `Y_Scale`, `Z_Scale`
  * `X_Location`, `Y_Location`, `Z_Location`

### **5. Constraint Framework (Conceptual)**

Although not active yet, this task defines the interface and logic points where constraints will later be inserted.
Planned constraints include:

* **Geometric feasibility** (volumes fully contained in fuselage shell)
* **Separation distance** between critical systems
* **Center-of-gravity balance**
* **Volume interdependency** (e.g., tanks aligned along reference axes)
* **Thermal/structural clearance**

### **6. Future Optimization Loop**

In the upcoming implementation, this process will be embedded in an **MDO optimization loop**, where:

* Each fuselage configuration is a candidate solution.
* Volume locations become optimization variables.
* Objective functions (mass balance, moment minimization, etc.) guide placement.

## **Examples**

### **Input CSV**

```
filename,length,width,height
fuselage_A.vsp3,3.4,0.8,0.9
fuselage_B.vsp3,4.2,1.0,1.1
```

### **Output Console**

```
[INFO] ../fuselage_iterator/fuselage_A.vsp3: Collision detected = False
[SUCCESS] Saved modified fuselage: ../fuselage_iterator/fuselage_A_with_volumes.vsp3

[INFO] ../fuselage_iterator/fuselage_B.vsp3: Collision detected = True
[SUCCESS] Saved modified fuselage: ../fuselage_iterator/fuselage_B_with_volumes.vsp3
```

### **OpenVSP Visualization**

* Ellipsoids (representing box volumes) appear inside the fuselage.
* Future tasks will replace them with accurate shapes once constraints are validated.

*(Visual references should be stored in `Images/Task3/`.)*

---

## **Limitations / Notes**

* **Current Implementation:**

  * Only box-type volumes are modeled.
  * Constraints and optimization routines are placeholders.
  * Volumes may extend outside the fuselage or overlap.

* **Error Handling:**

  * Some OpenVSP geometries (`POD`, `BOX`) cause parameter lookup errors (`Error Code 4`).
  * Switching to `ELLIPSOID` geometries avoids this issue.

* **Physical Constraints:**

  * None applied yet — all placements are random.
  * The goal of this phase is to confirm the stability of the generation pipeline.

* **Next Steps:**

  1. Implement mathematical constraint formulation (e.g., inequality functions for wall clearance and CoG balance).
  2. Integrate optimization solver (e.g., SciPy, PyOptSparse).
  3. Replace visualization ellipsoids with accurate shapes once geometry mapping is robust.
  4. Link results back to the MDO framework for automatic iteration.
