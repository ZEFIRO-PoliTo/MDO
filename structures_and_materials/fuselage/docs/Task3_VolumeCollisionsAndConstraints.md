1. **Task 3 – Collision Detection & Volume Constraints**


2. **Description**
The goal of this task is to place internal volumes inside a fuselage while ensuring:

   - Collision detection between volumes and fuselage walls.

   - Collision detection between volumes themselves.

   - Respect for user-defined distance constraints between specific volumes.

   - Volumes are modeled as ellipsoids (with dimensions length × width × height) and placed at defined positions.

3. **Inputs**

  -  Fuselage model (.vsp3)
    
  -  Loaded via Config.INPUT_VSP
    
  -  Manual volume definitions (get_manual_volumes_example()) Each volume includes:

        - ID
        
        - Position: (x, y, z) in meters
        
        - Dimensions: (length, width, height) in meters
        
        - Distance constraints: List[Tuple[target_volume_id, min_distance_m]]
    
  -  Configuration parameters (Config)
    
        - NUM_VOLUMES: total volumes to place
        
        - SAFETY_MARGIN: fraction of local cross-section radius for clearance
        
        - LONGITUDINAL_MARGIN: margin from fuselage ends
        
        - U_SAMPLES, W_SAMPLES: surface sampling resolution

4. **Outputs**
- Placed volumes inside fuselage. Only valid volumes that:
  
  - Do not intersect fuselage walls.

  -  Do not collide with each other.
    
  -  Respect distance constraints.

- Files generated in configs/confX/:

  -  .vsp3 file: fuselage + placed volumes
    
  -  volumes_positions.csv: ID, position, and dimensions of volumes
    
  -  distance_constraints.csv: all constraints and verification status

 - volumes_data.json: additional metadata for the configuration (not requested but maybe useful for the future)

5. **Algorithm / Procedure**

   1. Load Fuselage

      - Reset OpenVSP model
    
      - Load input .vsp3
    
      - Find fuselage geometry by name ("fuselage" or "fuse")

   2. Analyze Real Fuselage Surface

      - Sample U_SAMPLES along fuselage length
    
      - Sample W_SAMPLES points around fuselage circumference per section
    
      - Compute:
    
        - Cross-section centers (center_y, center_z)
    
        - Effective radii (radius_y, radius_z)
    
        - Cross-section area

    3. Manual Volume Placement

       - Iterate through manually defined volumes
    
       - Validate each volume:

         - Inside fuselage: check X, Y, Z bounds with safety margin
    
         - Collision check with already placed volumes
    
         - Respect distance constraints relative to other manual volumes

       - Place only valid volumes in OpenVSP as ellipsoids
    
       - Update OpenVSP after each placement

    4. Collision and Constraint Handling
    
       - Fuselage walls: ensure y_extent and z_extent ≤ safe radii from cross-section

       - Volume collisions: center-to-center distance vs average radii
    
       - Distance constraints: verify minimum distance for defined volume pairs
    
    5. Save Configuration

       - Auto-number configurations (conf1, conf2, …)
    
       - Save:
    
         - .vsp3 file
    
         - volumes_positions.csv
    
         - distance_constraints.csv
    
         - volumes_data.json with:
    
           - Configuration metadata
    
           - Real cross-section data
    
           - Volume dimensions & distance constraints

   *Libraries used:*

   - openvsp (as vsp): for loading fuselage models, adding and transforming geometries, sampling points on surfaces, and saving .vsp3 files.

   - csv: for writing volume positions and distance constraint verification tables.

   - json: for exporting enhanced configuration data including sampled surface points.
    
   - os: for file and directory handling, including creating configuration folders.
    
   - math: for distance calculations and basic geometric operations.
    
   - dataclasses: to define EllipsoidVolume, CrossSection, and FuselageBounds with automatic attribute management.
    
   - typing: to define type hints like List, Tuple, and Optional for clarity and type safety.


6. **Limitations / Notes**
   - Only ellipsoids are used for volume shapes (no cubes/parallelepiped yet).
   - Distances and collisions are approximate using average radii for ellipsoids.
   - In highly irregular fuselages, cross-section interpolation may not be fully accurate; direct per-section checks using meshes may improve precision.
