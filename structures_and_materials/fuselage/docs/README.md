# Project Documentation Guidelines

This folder contains all the documentation for the MDO fuselage project.
Each task should have its own Markdown file describing the work, inputs, outputs, and results.

3. **Inputs**
   - Parameters required
   - Data format

4. **Outputs**
   - Expected results (files, data structures, or visualizations)

5. **Algorithm / Procedure**
   - Main steps and logic

## Tips

- Use **clear headings and bullet points** for readability.
- Store all images in the `Images/` folder and link them in the Markdown file.
- Each task owner should maintain and update their own task documentation.
- Link task documentation in this `README.md` to create an index:

```markdown
# Documentation Index

- [Task 2 – Volume Distribution](Task2_VolumeDistribution.md)
